# Webpack So Good!

This is a companion sample project for [a talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1faCqPeacpfO_RKOhEYIIgyhio1IjZ08toUDThqCDHOo/edit?usp=sharing) I gave at Indy.rb on 2017-11-08.

My goal with this project was to show off a few of the features of webpack and Webpacker, especially:

- Setting up a couple basic React components
- Adding a plugin (webpack-dashboard)
- Using ES6 imports for JS, CSS, images, and even markdown

This project was generated with `rails new webpack-so-good --webpack=react`. From there, feel free to walk through the commit history to see the small changes I made!
